    <span>Week 4: Cultural Discusson - Diversity In Tech</span>
    <span>January 24th, 2016</span>
    <div>
    While I may be new to pursuing a career in technology, it comes as no surprise to me that the tech industry is facing some serious issues with diversity. From 2002 to 2006 I attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and many of my friends were engineering students. These friends - specifically the computer science majors - would often lament the lack of women in their classes. Fast forward ten years, and now some of those same friends work for companies where their co-workers are almost entirely male, and mostly White or Asian.

    <div>
    Some organizations have claimed they don't intend to discriminate; that they simply do not get many applications from qualified women and underrepresented minorities. However, the statistics don't necessarily support that. A <a href = "http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/10/12/silicon-valley-diversity-tech-hiring-computer-science-graduates-african-american-hispanic/14684211/">USA Today analysis</a> from 2014 showed that "4.5% of all new recipients of bachelor's degrees in computer science or computer engineering from prestigious research universities were African American, and 6.5% were Hispanic..." while "...on average, just 2% of technology workers at seven Silicon Valley companies that have released staffing numbers are Black; 3% are Hispanic." Google's </a href = "http://www.google.com/diversity/">diversity numbers</a> from January 2015 also highlight the gender imbalance - only 30% of employess are women, and that number sinks to 18% in technical roles. While I'm certainly not an expert on the subject, I can think of a few problems in our society that contribute to this imbalance:
    </div><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Unequal access: Black and Latino students are more likely to attend high schools with limited access to modern technological equipment and advanced computer science classes. (This <a href = "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/nina-rees/2014/03/24/report-shows-huge-disparities-between-white-and-minority-students">US News report</a> addresses the gravity of the problem). This may discourage many of them from taking an early interest in the field, and put them at a grave disadvantage in college and the workforce.</li><br>
        <li>Gender stereotypes: Women in my family and peer group have repeated a similar version of this story to me for years: early in life, an adult (whether a parent, teacher, or other authority figure) may begin to treat boys and girls differently - suggesting to young girls that math and science are not viable career paths for them, and failing to nurture their natural abilities in technical fields. It's not hard to see how this might deter young women from choosing academic and career paths in tech.</li><br>
        <li>Unwelcomeness: This <a href = "http://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Tech-s-diversity-problem-goes-beyond-dismal-6391934.php">SF Chronicle article</a>shows how women and minorities can often be made to feel unwelcome in the tech industry - whether through explicit bigotry or more subtle microaggressions.</li><br>
        <li>Outright discrimination: Yup. While we've undoubtedly progressed as a nation on some issues, America -  actually, anywhere on Earth - can still be an ugly, sexist, racist place at times. (Read some of the comments on an article about sexism or racism, or take a look at some threads on <a href ="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a>, or spend time on <a href= "http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> if you dispute this.) </li></br>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
    After significant pressure from the public, major technology companies have beginning their diversity data. This is a start, as we can't start solving a problem until we admit there is indeed a problem and identify it. Bootcamps like <a href="http://www.telegraphacademy.com">Telegraph Academy</a> and <a href= "https://hackbrightacademy.com">Hackbright Academy</a> aim to bring more underrepresented people of color and women (respectively) into the tech work force. <a href ="http://www.hackthehood.org">Hack The Hood</a> introduces low-income youth of color to careers in tech. These are all signs of progress - however, I feel that we must work on eradicating discrimination and bigotry in our society as a whole, and improving the quality of public education, so that everyone can one day have a fair and equal shot at working in one of the most in-demand and lucrative industries of our time.
