    <span>Week 1: Version Control, Git, and GitHub</span>
    <span>January 3rd, 2016</span>
    <p>
      Greetings! Welcome to the first entry in my technical blog. In this week's blog we will discuss version control, Git, and GitHub.
    </p>
    <p>
        First let's discuss version control. For the sake of simplicity, we'll discuss it here as it applies to code - however, version control could theoretically be used for any sort of project. Version control is a system of recording and tracking any updates or changes to a file (or set of files). Version control can be useful to an individual developer, but is particularly beneficial when several developers are working on a project.
    </p>
    <p>
        To show how version control can be beneficial to a team of developers, let's say that three developers are working on a project at the same time. Each developer may want to add different code to the project, but without version control, there's a good chance that one developer could easily overwrite another's code. Using version control, each developer can submit their own version of the project for review - all previous versions of the projects will be saved in case the updated version does not function properly.
    <p>
    <p>
        Now let's discuss Git. Git is software (run from your local computer) that enables you to keep track of changes to your files and also "push" (upload) them to remote sites such as GitHub (we'll talk more about GitHub later on).
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's say you have made changes to a file (or set of files) and want to propose these changes. You can use the command "git add <filename>" to add a single file to your Index, or "git add * " to add all the working directory's files that have been changed since your last update. Then, you can use "git commit" to confirm these changes (or "commit" them) to your local computer. When you commit changes, be sure to add a commit message so that anyone viewing your changes can understand 1) what you changed and 2) why.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, let's discuss GitHub. GitHub is a website where you can store files remotely. You can use the Git software to easily upload and download files to and from GitHub. Being able to access files remotely is very important as it makes it easy to share files between developers, and also makes things easier for you if you're working from multiple locations. It's very convenient as it's easy to use with Git and enables you to see the several different branches (or versions) of a project, as well as to see what changes have been made, and why.
