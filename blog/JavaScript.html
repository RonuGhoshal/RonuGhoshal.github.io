    <span>Week 7: Looping in JavaScript vs. Looping in Ruby</span>
    <span>February 15th, 2016</span>

    <div>
    Welcome back. In this week's blog, we will discuss looping in JavaScript and compare it to looping in Ruby. For the purpose of this exercise, we will use a simple data structure - an array - which we will loop through. Our array will be <strong>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</strong>.
    </div>
   <div>
    Let's say we wanted to output each item in this array to the console. Here's one way we could do it in Ruby:
    <pre><code>
      array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      counter = 0
      while counter < array.length
        puts array[counter]
        counter += 1
      end
    </code></pre>
    This is rather complicated and it's really not necessary to create the "counter" variable when we have Ruby's built in ".each" method:
   <pre><code>
    array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    array.each do |x|
      puts x
    end
    </code></pre>
    That looks much nicer and requires much less writing. In JavaScript, we don't have an ".each" method but we do have "while" loops. Let's demonstrate here:
      <pre><code>
      var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
      var counter = 0;
      while (counter < array.length) {
        console.log(array[counter]);
        counter += 1;
      }
    </code></pre>
    Other than the syntax, this is basically the same as our ugly while loop from the first example. Luckily, we can use "for" loops to simplify things:
    <pre><code>
    var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    for (var x=0; x < array.length; x++) {
      console.log(array[x]);
    }
    </code></pre>
    The loop states that x starts out with a value of zero (x=0), and will increment (x++) by 1 as long as the second condition holds true (x < array.length). We can even simplify things further:
    <pre><code>
    var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    for (var x in array) {
      console.log(array[x]);
    }
    </code></pre>
    Here it's important to remember that the "x" refers to the <strong>index</strong> of each element in the array, and not to the element itself. "For" loops seem to be one of the most powerful and common features in JavaScript so I recommend getting very comfortable with using them!
