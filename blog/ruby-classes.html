    <span>Week 6: Ruby Classes</span>
    <span>February 7th, 2016</span>

    <div>
    This week we will be discussing the Ruby elements known as classes. Classes are used to create, store, and organize objects in Ruby - in fact, every Ruby object belongs to a class.
    </div><br>
    <div>
    To demonstrate how classes work, let's take the simple example of a class called Country, used to group different countries of the world. Each country has a capital, population, and most commonly spoken language, so we'll want to make sure we include this information in our class. Let's create the class and include an "initialize" method (when creating a class in Ruby, creating this method is an essential step.)
    <pre><code>
    class Country
      def initialize(capital, population, language)
      @capital = capital
      @population = population
      @language = language
      end
    end
   </code></pre>
   </div>
   <div>
   Let's discuss this initialize method, and the variables we created. When you create a new instance of Country (by calling Country.new), Ruby will create this object and then call the "initialize" method, passing in the variables "capital", "population", and "language."
   </div></br>
  <div>
  Since each instance of the Country class represents a different country, it will need to store its own specific information. This is where we will use instance variables - we create an instance variable by putting the @ symbol before the name. Let's demonstrate by creating an object to represent the United States.
  <pre><code>
  united_states = Country.new("Washington, D.C.", 323000000, "English")
  </code></pre>
  This creates a new object "united_states", belonging to the class "Country." It also passes the string "Washington D.C" into the instance variable @capital, the integer 323000000 to @population, and "English" to @language.
  </div>
  <div>
  For any country we create here, we'll want to access this information - here's where we can create an instance method to output this information in plain English.
  <pre><code>
  def describe
    puts "The capital is #{@capital}, the population is #{population}, and the most commonly spoken language is #{language}."
  end
  </code></pre>
  Then, we can call the describe method by entering <strong>united_states.describe</strong> . This will give us the output: "The capital is Washington, D.C., the population is 323000000, and the most commonly spoken language is English." We could do the same thing if we wanted to create an object to represent, say, Peru:
  <pre><code>
  peru = Country.new("Lima", 31000000, "Spanish")
  peru.describe
  </code></pre>
  This will give us the output: "The capital is lima, the population is 31000000, and the most commonly spoken language is Spanish."
  </div>
  <div>
  Hopefully this Country class example has been able to better explain the concept of Ruby classes, instance variables, and instance methods. Some other ideas for classes to play around with if you're looking to practice could be Pet, Movie, or Vehicle. The possibilities are basically endless!
